# Introduction to Churn Analysis

In today’s competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. Churn analysis is a key technique used to understand and reduce this customer attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions. This knowledge allows companies to take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.


Project Target

Create an entire ETL process in a database & a Power BI dashboard to utilize the Customer Data and achieve below goals:

    Visualize & Analyse Customer Data at below levels
    Demographic
    Geographic
    Payment & Account Info
    Services
    Study Churner Profile & Identify Areas for Implementing Marketing Campaigns
    Identify a Method to Predict Future Churners

 

Metrics Required

    Total Customers
    Total Churn & Churn Rate
    New Joiners

# STEP 1 – ETL Process in SQL Server

So the first step in churn analysis is to load the data from our source file. For this purpose we will be using Microsoft SQL server because it is a widely used solution across the industry and also because a full-fledged Database System is better at handling recurring data loads and maintaining data integrity compared to an excel file


Creating Database

After installation, you will land on the following screen. Do remember to copy paste the server name somewhere because we will need this at a later stage. Also enable the checkbox which says “Trust Server Certificate” and then click on Connect

Once connected, click on NEW QUERY button at the top ribbon and then write below query. This will create a new Database named db_Churn

CREATE DATABASE db_Churn

 

Import csv into SQL server staging table – Import Wizard

Right click on the newly created database in the explorer window and then go to

Task >> Import >> Flat file >> Browse CSV file

Remember to add customerId as primary key and allow nulls for all remaining columns. This is done to avoid any errors while data load. Also make sure to change the datatype where it say Bit to Varchar(50). We are doing this because while using import wizard I faced issues with the BIT data type, however Varchar(50) works fine.

Data Exploration – Check Distinct Values

SELECT Gender, Count(Gender) as TotalCount,
Count(Gender)  1.0 / (Select Count() from stg_Churn)  as Percentage
from stg_Churn
Group by Gender

 

SELECT Contract, Count(Contract) as TotalCount,
Count(Contract)  1.0 / (Select Count() from stg_Churn)  as Percentage
from stg_Churn
Group by Contract

Sum(Total_Revenue) / (Select sum(Total_Revenue) from stg_Churn) * 100  as RevPercentage

Group by Customer_Status

 

SELECT State, Count(State) as TotalCount,

# STEP 5 – Predict Customer Churn

For predicting customer churn, we will be using a widely used Machine Learning algorithm called RANDOM FOREST.

What is Random Forest?A random forest is a machine learning algorithm that consists of multiple decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions (in regression tasks) or taking the majority vote (in classification tasks) from all the trees in the forest. This ensemble approach improves the accuracy and robustness of the model by reducing the risk of overfitting compared to using a single decision tree.

 

Data Preparation for ML model

Let us first import views in an Excel file.

o   Go to Data >> Get Data >> SQL Server Database

o   Enter the Server Name & Database name to connect to SQL Server

o   Import both vw_ChurnData & vw_JoinData

o   Save the file as Prediction_Data
